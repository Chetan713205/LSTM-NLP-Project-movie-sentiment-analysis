**Sentiment Analysis of IMDb Reviews Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning**

### **Project Description**:
Developed and implemented a sentiment analysis system for IMDb movie reviews using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The project involved preprocessing text data, building predictive models, and creating an interactive web interface for real-time sentiment prediction.

- **Data Handling**: Cleaned and preprocessed a comprehensive dataset, including tokenization, lemmatization, and vectorization. Managed data merging, duplication, and balancing to ensure robust model training.

- **Model Development**:
  - **Machine Learning**: Implemented and trained an MLPClassifier, achieving 87.6% accuracy and an AUC-ROC score of 87.6%.
  - **Deep Learning**: Built and trained an LSTM model, reaching a perfect classification accuracy.

- **Evaluation**: Conducted thorough model evaluations using confusion matrices, accuracy scores, AUC-ROC scores, and classification reports to assess performance.

- **Interactive Interface**: Developed an interactive web interface using Gradio for real-time sentiment analysis, allowing users to input text and receive sentiment predictions.

- **Technologies Used**: Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk, tensorflow, Gradio
